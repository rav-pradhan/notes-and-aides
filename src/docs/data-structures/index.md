## What are Data Structures?

Data structures are the concrete implementations of Abstract Data Types (ADTs).

ADTs are defined by **behaviours**. Barbara Liskov and Stephen Zilles, in 1974, identified how ADTs consist of the following:

- A collection of data - values stored within.
- A set of _operations_ that can be performed on the data, or subsets of data.
- A group of _axioms_ - these are essentially self-evident rules in which the way we can interact with them are governed.

A couple of examples of the relationship between ADTs and data structures:

>**ADT**: `list`
>
>**Data Structure**: `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`

>**ADT**: `map`
>
>**Data Structure**: `HashMap`, `HashTable`
