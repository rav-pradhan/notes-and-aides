## Systems Thinking 101

Systems thinking is an holistic approach to analysis that focuses on the way that a system's constituent parts interrelate, and how systems work over time and within the context of larger systems.

Systems thinking is discipline-agnostic and has been used in various areas of research and industry, including medicine, ecology, politics, economics and software engineering.

Systems thinking is underpinned by the idea that system behaviours are the results from the effects of reinforcing and balancing processes.

Specifically, an emphasis on [feedback loops](/docs/systems-thinking/feedback-loops) is essential to understanding systems thinking.
