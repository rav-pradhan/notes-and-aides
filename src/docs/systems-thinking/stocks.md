## What are stocks?

Stocks are the elements of the system you can see, feel, count or measure. They are the atomic units that build up a system. Books in a bookstore, water in a bath tub, money in the bank. It does not have to be physical. Goodwill to others is a stock.

Stocks can change through actions of a flow. Purchases and sales, growths vs. decay, successes vs. failure. A stock is the present memory of the history of changing flows within the system.

E.g. an underground mineral deposit is a stock. Out comes the flow of ore. All system models are simplified descriptions of the real world.

Understanding stocks and flows and their behaviours means you can then understand the complexities of a system.

All models - mental, mathematical - are simplifications of the real world. You can extend principles to more complex systems through them.

If the sum of all outflows equals the sum of all inflows - dynamic equilibrium is achieved. Otherwise, stocks can rise or flow depending on the outflow/inflow values.

E.g., You can prolong the life of an oil-based economy by finding more oil fields. Similarly, a company can build a larger workforce by more hiring or decreasing employee churn.

A stock can be increased by decreasing its outflow rate, or by increasing its inflow rate.

Stocks usually change slowly. Stocks, especially large ones, respond to change - sudden or otherwise - through gradual filling/emptying.

The larger the system, the slower its stock is to change.

The presence of stocks allow inflow/outflows to be independent of each other.

Human beings have invented hundreds of stock maintaining measures. E.g., Reservoirs for farmers, banks for money handling. Stocks allow inflow/outflows to be decoupled, to be independent and temporarily out of balance with each other.

People monitor stocks constantly and make decisions to increase/lower/maintain them all the time.
