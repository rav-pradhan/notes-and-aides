## What are feedback loops?

A feedback loop is a structure within a system that causes output from one node to eventually influence the input within that very node.

Consider the example of a Population Growth system, and the specific [stock](/docs/systems-thinking/stocks) of _work output_.

The work output affects the *goods and services* available for a population. This can increase the *average life expectancy*. This can in turn increase the *population*, which has the potential to increase the work output even more. This would be an example of a **reinforcing feedback loop**

## Reinforcing Feedback Loop

A reinforcing feedback loop - also known as a positive feedback loop - is when an initial change is reinvested to further perpetuate that change in the future.

Reinforcing loops get things moving and build momentum.
