## What is lean?

The core idea of lean is to maximise customer value, whilst minimising waste. That is to say, create more value with fewer resources.

A lean organisation understands customer value and focuses its key processes to continuously increase it. The ultimate goal is to provide perfect value through a perfect value creation process that has zero waste.

Lean thinking changes the focus of management from optimising separate technologies, assets, and vertical departments, to optimising the flow of products and services through entire value streams that flow horizontally across technologies, assets, and departments to customers.

Eliminating waste along entire value streams, instead of at isolated points, creates processes that need less human effort, less space, less capital, and less time to make products and services at far less costs with much fewer defects.

Companies are able to respond to customer desires with higher variety, higher quality, lower cost, and faster throughput times.

Information management also becomes much simpler and more accurate, owing to waste elimination.

## Lean for Production and Services

A popular misconception about lean is that it's only suited for manufacturing. In fact, lean applies to every business and every process. It is not a tactic or a cost reduction program, but instead a way of thinking and acting for an entire organisation.

## Purpose, Process, People

Womack and Jones, in their influential book, *Lean Thinking*, recommend that managers and executives embarked on lean transformations think about three fundamental business issues that should guide the transformation of the *entire organisation*:

- **Purpose**: What customer problems will the enterprise solve to achieve its own purpose of prospering?
- **Process**: How will the organisation assess each major value stream to make sure each step is valuable, capable, available, adequate, flexible, and that all the steps are linked by flow, pull, and leveling?
- **People**: How can the organisation ensure that every important process has someone responsible for continually evaluating that value stream in terms of business purpose and lean process? How can everyone touching the value stream be actively engaged in operating it correctly and continually improving it?
