## What is a Lean Value Tree?

A Lean Value Tree (LVT) is a conceptual tool that is used to facilitate, share and drive strategy and vision across hierarchies. These hierarchies could be at a personal scope, or they could be divisional or organisational.

## Why use an LVT?

LVTs use a [lean approach](notes/organisational-strategy/lean) that focuses on value delivery. It guides decisions and initiatives that tightly integrate with value and vision, whilst also helping to avoid wasteful processes and initiatives.

## How do you do an LVT?

The LVT follows a top-down framework, split into four levels:

1. Vision
2. Goal(s)
3. Bet(s)
4. Initiative(s)

### Goals

LVT goals should be strategic and ambitious, and must ultimately align with whatever the vision is. Goals in the context of an LVT should focus on high-level outcomes rather than tactical opportunities, specific solutions or outputs.

Consider them the `interface` to your `implementation`.

### Bets

Every goal is broken down into a set of strategic bets. A bet is a value hypothesis that whoever is invested in the LVT believes can help achieve the goal with which the bet is associated with.

If a bet does not function, then it is taken out of the tree. This ensures that time is not spent on something that is not achieving the overall vision.

### Initiatives

Initiatives define what should be done to test the value hypothesis of the associated bet.

Typically, they take the shape of one or more smaller hypotheses that clearly measure success. Through initiatives, short term decisions can be made to determine if the hypothesis is approved or denied.

Initiatives are not projects. The difference between the two is that a project has a fixed deadline, whereas initiatives do not. Initiatives should be tested within a product backlog with constantly evolving hypotheses and re-prioritisation until such time that the value hypothesis of the overall initiative is proven or disproven.
