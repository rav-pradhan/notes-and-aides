## What is a code smell?

A code smell is a superficial sign that suggests there is a deeper problem with a given system. They often further suggest that Clean Code practices are not being followed; this may mean difficulties in maintaining the codebase in the long term.

It can be challenging to determine what is a code smell. However, through experience and exposure to different codebases and coding contexts, developers can get a "feel" for what constitutes a code smell.

It is important to remember that a code smell is only a _hint_ that something is awry, not a definitive indication. Identifying a potential code smell is not an attack on an individual developer or team, but is rather a sign that it may be worth investigating the potential smell further to determine if a refactor is worth making.
