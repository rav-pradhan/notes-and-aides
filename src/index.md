Welcome to this small corner of the web where I've decided to share my notes on all things related to technology and design. I intend to write up notes on topics as technical as EC2, as broad as web accessibility, and as conceptual as Systems Thinking.

The notes here may be tidy - or not-so-tidy - and topics may contain chapters that are somewhat scattershot, or missing. This is likely down to me not getting around to updating the content yet, so bear with me if that's the case.

Fundamentally, though, I'm recording these pages here for reasons twofold: my own personal use, and also for anyone who may find my rambling records useful.

I'm only one person, and there can be times when my notes are inaccurate or too reductive. If you have any comments on that note (no pun intended), then feel free to reach out to me on [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/raviipx).
